<h1>Harmonizer for iOS and Android</h1>
<p>Harmonizer is an Open Source mobile application currently in development. Harmonizer aims to help musicians create harmonies in their own music and become more skilled in hearing harmony in music.
Users will record voice or instrument input and the app will return a version of the audio with harmonized voices.
